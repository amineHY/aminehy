A technical lead and cloud/data platforms architect focused on building reliable, observable, cost-aware AI & analytics foundations (MLOps + LLMOps + data engineering). I help teams ship production ML and GenAI responsibly.

*Fast glance:* Core focus, projects, stack, mentoring, stats, contact.

=== Core Focus
* Scalable cloud-native Data & AI platforms (AWS / Azure / Databricks)
* Production MLOps & LLMOps (CI/CD, evaluation, governance, observability)
* Retrieval + GenAI integration (RAG pipelines, embedding quality, latency)
* Data quality, lineage, reproducibility & cost efficiency

=== Selected Projects
* Awesome LLM Apps – curated LLM use cases (RAG, multi-agent): https://github.com/amineHY/awesome-llm-apps
* assimilate_llm – experimentation harness for LLM workflows & evaluation: https://github.com/amineHY/assimilate_llm
* rag_langchain / rag_deeplearning_ai – comparative retrieval pipeline patterns: https://github.com/amineHY/rag_langchain
* semantic_search_mongodb – vector + semantic search over operational data: https://github.com/amineHY/semantic_search_mongodb
* auto_data_scientist – automation of routine data science tasks: https://github.com/amineHY/auto_data_scientist

=== Tech Stack (Condensed)
Python, Spark, Delta Lake, Databricks, MLflow, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis.

=== Mentoring & Community
* Trained 50+ consultants (Spark & Databricks enablement)
* Coached 20+ data scientists / ML engineers
* Talks: cloud data platforms, MLOps, LLMOps, retrieval optimization
* OSS experimentation: RAG, semantic search, multi-agent orchestration

=== How I Work
Pragmatic architecture • Shift-left governance • Deterministic builds • Automation-first • Measured performance & drift • Continuous enablement.

=== Publications (Selected)
Detection of epileptics during seizure free periods | Convolution kernels for multi-wavelength imaging | Spatio-Spectral Multichannel Reconstruction from few Low-Resolution Multispectral Data | Restoration of astrophysical objects from multispectral data

=== Certifications
Neural Networks and Deep Learning | Improving Deep Neural Networks | Workshop on System and Signal Processing and their Applications
